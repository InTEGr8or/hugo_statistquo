If the statist ideal is wrong, it must be demonstrable to be wrong as opposed to something that is right. Things can only be wrong in relation to some truth, which they can be shown to be in opposition to, which they can be show to _contradict_.



- Rebranding: The statist must continuously _rebrand_ statism as, "progressivism", "liberalism", "socialism", "democratic socialism", non of which are accurate descriptions, and each of which are cynical usurpations of descriptions that statism stands in opposition against, but which is recognized an admired and coveted prestige.
    - Progressivism: Statists are against progress and in favor of stasis. The state passes laws in direct and stated opposition to progress. They pass laws explicitly prohibiting progress. Which group does this? The group that calls themselves progressive.
